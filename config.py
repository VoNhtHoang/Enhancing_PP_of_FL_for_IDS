"""Dataset Formatting"""
# When set to True, simulation uses cumulative datasets (i.e., each iteration includes the last), which also affects the way
# training is done. With cumulative datasets, each iteration each client trains on its dataset from scratch.

"""Security"""

"""Differential Privacy"""
# USE_DP_PRIVACY: Whether to implement differential privacy functionality. Defaults to laplacian noise.

# DP_ALGORITHM: either Laplace or Gamma. Can easily add more in client agent's code
